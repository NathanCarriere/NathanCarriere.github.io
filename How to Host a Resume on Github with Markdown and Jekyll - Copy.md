# How to Host a Resume on Github with Markdown and Jekyll



This article will go over the basics of using Markdown, a Markdown editor, Github Pages, and Jekyll. By the end of this, you should be able to host your own resume on Github using the described tools. This assumes a novice level of computer science knowledge, with no experience with Markdown or Github required (see the Table of Contents if you want to skip some sections).

### Introduction

###### 

###### Motivation

"What's the point?" is often the first question I ask whenever learning something. Let's address this immediately. Here are some reasons to consider hosting a resume on Github:

- It shows technical proficiency.

- It shows initiative.

- It provides a convenient place to display side projects.

- It's quite easy to learn how to do.

- It gives you valuable practice in increasingly popular tools.



###### Technology Overview

What technology do I need and what does it do?" are often my second and third questions. Here's a quick overview of the technology we'll be looking at:

- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): a lightweight [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) which has recently become quite popular. It is designed to be easy to write, read, and learn.

- [Marktext](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/blob/develop/README.md): a markdown editor. Markdown editors allow you to write markdown without much prerequisite knowledge. This specific editor is not required - other editors are acceptable (just ensure they use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), or Github may give you difficulties).

- [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) is a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) [hosting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service) that takes files from Github and uses them to publish a website. It is quite intuitive once you get the hang of it. This can be used to publish things such as resume's. 

- [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) is a static site generator that is built-in to Github Pages. We won't go into much more detail than is required to use this, but links to guides will be provided.



### Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) has a plethora of concise online tutorials/references. For a quick two-minute introduction, see either [this quick reference](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/) or [this quick guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). For something more in-depth, see [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). In my experience, I think that a good Markdown editor plus some Google searches is really all you need to know about syntax to get going. Here is a quick rundown on the most important details:

- Markdown was designed to be easy to read and easy to learn.

- Markdown has many "flavours". These are slightly different implementations of the specification, tailored to different needs and specifications. We will use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) because we will be hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)

- Markdown is easy to use. 

- Did I mention Markdown is easy to use? You don't even need to understand the syntax to begin writing it. The existence of Markdown editors means that, if you can use a basic text editor, then you can write Markdown!

- Google is your friend. If you're trying to format something, it's almost guaranteed that someone else had the same problem. 



### Markdown editors

Regardless of the individual, some sort of text editor will need to be used to write Markdown. If you will be spending significant time writing Markdown, it is important that you select one that will improve your productivity. 

A good Markdown editor will (in my opinion):

- Show you a preview of your Markdown as you write.

- Provide keyboard shortcuts (eg. being able to use `ctrl+b` to add bold tags).

- Offer auto-complete features (these improve productivity in the long run).

- Write in the flavour of Markdown that you intend on using.

- Require as few syntax Google searches as possible.

There are many Markdown editors which satisfy these requirements, but one that I would recommend is [Marktext](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/blob/develop/README.md). If you can use Microsoft Word, then you can use Marktext.

### FAQ

###### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

- Markdown is a markup language designed to be viewed on the web. It's designed to have CSS and other technology run through it efficiently. This is why websites use markup languages instead of Microsoft Word .docx files. (Also, good luck trying to navigate or read [the mess that is .docx raw source code](https://www.toptal.com/xml/an-informal-introduction-to-docx))

**I can see the README on Github Pages but not my resume. What's wrong?**

- If this is the case, there's a good chance you're just looking at the wrong URL.
